            Our Founding Principles & Sydney Origins
          </h2>
          <p>
            Established in {BRAND.foundingYear} in Alexandria, Sydney, Mr Meat & Co was created to solve a growing problem in modern Australian meat retail: the disconnect between pasture-raised farmers and urban home cooks. As industrial supermarkets pushed central processing, chemical preservatives, and water-pumped meats into pre-packaged trays, our founders set out to build a traditional, transparent, whole-carcass craft butcher workshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that extraordinary meals begin with extraordinary livestock stewardship. Every piece of beef, lamb, and poultry handled in our Sydney workshop originates from 100% Australian family farms that adhere to strict 100-day grass-fed and free-range pasture grazing standards. By working directly with producers across regional New South Wales, the Riverina, and the Central Tablelands, we guarantee complete traceability from paddock to plate.
          </p>

            Freshness Without Preservatives: Daily In-House Butchery
          </h2>
          <p>
            The cornerstone of our workshop is our signature Grass-Fed Premium Beef Mince. While mass-market mince is often reconstituted from frozen trim blocks and treated with nitrogen gas to artificially extend shelf color, our beef mince is ground fresh every single morning using whole chuck, brisket, and flank trim from freshly broken primals.
          </p>
          <p>
            We maintain exact lean-to-fat ratios—85/15 for our everyday premium mince and 80/20 for our Wagyu Reserve blend—without adding water, synthetic binding agents, or artificial nitrates. Our master butchers trim, portion, and vacuum-pack or butcher-wrap each order specifically for your scheduled delivery window, ensuring that the meat you receive retains its natural muscle structure, high protein density, and rich authentic beef flavor.

            Temperature-Controlled Cold-Chain Express Delivery
          </h2>
          <p>
            Craft butchery is only half of the equation; maintaining an unbroken cold chain until the parcel arrives at your kitchen counter is equally crucial. To achieve this, Mr Meat & Co engineered a specialized refrigerated packaging and logistics framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every order is carefully packed inside 100% recyclable thermal insulated box liners alongside heavy-duty non-toxic gel ice packs capable of sustaining sub-4°C internal temperatures for up to 36 hours. Our fleet of specialized refrigerated delivery vehicles services Greater Sydney Metro, Wollongong, and the Central Coast. Whether you are home or at work, your meat order stays safely chilled until you are ready to transfer it to your refrigerator or freezer.

            Direct Ordering, PayID & Crypto Innovation
          </h2>
          <p>
            We believe in passing operational savings directly back to our customers. By streamlining our ordering process through direct web-assisted order drafts, WhatsApp messaging, PayID, and direct Cryptocurrency payments (Bitcoin BTC and Tether USDT), we bypass expensive credit card processing fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            We pass those savings directly to you: every customer who pays with cryptocurrency (Bitcoin BTC or Tether USDT) automatically receives an instant 10% discount off their total order. PayID and bank transfer are also accepted with no card surcharge. Combined with our free refrigerated express delivery on all orders ($300 AUD min order), Sydney households enjoy premium restaurant-grade butcher meats at fair, transparent pricing.
